# proteomics Quality Control
Relative proteomic quantification, including TMT(Tandem Mass Tag), using isobaric labeling technology has developed into a key tool for comparing the expression of proteins in biological samples. Isobaric labeling quantitative proteomic is complicated, requiring sample preparation, mass spectrometry acquistion and data analysis.
sample preparation: proteins reduction and allkylation- protein digestion into peptides- peptides labeled with isotopically labeled reagents(fractionated and desalted) 
data analysis : proteolytic peptides should be identified, the reporter ions must be quantified, the quantification data should be normalized, peptide-level data should be assembled into the protein quantification results.

The process is complex so it is important to scrutinize the quality of the data that becomes a basis for biological and medical conclusions.
