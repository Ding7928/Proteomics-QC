# Proteomics Quality Control
Relative proteomic quantification, including TMT(Tandem Mass Tag), using isobaric labeling technology has developed into a key tool for comparing the expression of proteins in biological samples. Isobaric labeling quantitative proteomic is complicated, requiring sample preparation, mass spectrometry acquistion and data analysis.
It is important to scrutinize the quality of the data that becomes a basis for biological and medical conclusions.
